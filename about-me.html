    <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>

    <p>
        I chose web development because it allows me to turn my
        <strong>ideas into reality</strong>. I love creating things
        that people can <strong>see, feel, and interact with</strong>
        through a screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        Web development perfectly blends <strong>creativity and logic</strong>.
        Designing layouts, choosing colors, and shaping user experiences
        while writing clean, logical code makes learning both
        <strong>exciting and meaningful</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every line of code feels like building something from nothing.
        Solving problems, fixing bugs, and watching a project come to life
        gives me a strong sense of <strong>achievement and motivation</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe web development has a <strong>powerful future</strong>.
        It enables me to solve <strong>real-world problems</strong>,
        create useful digital solutions, and continuously grow in a
        fast-evolving technological world.
